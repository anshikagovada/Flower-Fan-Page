In the center of the flower is black because that is where sunflower seeds actually grow. Sunflowers are known as the happy flower, so sunflowers are a great flower to gift to your loved ones. 

## Jasmines
Jasmines are my personal favorite. They are beautiful white flowers that have an amazing smell. I just love tieing them togther onto string and putting it is my hair overnight. It makes my hair have that beautiful scent. The flower itself are pretty small making it very easy to just take a few when leaving. Jasmines are typically grown in warmer temperatures.
